# Interactive Painting

For this project, I propose to create an interactive digital painting based on 'Woman with a Flower' by Paul Gauguin.

## Summary

Since I am an illustration major, it is always in my interest to somehow combine art and technology. I love seeing old masters' works being taken and submerged into new media, and I would like to try my own hand at doing that. I will have a touchscreen that will display the painting that I have made using code, and will have the pixels of the space that we touched be dispersed.

## Component Parts

- Arduino Uno (INPUT & OUTPUT)
- 5.0" 40-pin TFT Display with touchscreen, bought from the Adafruit website (OUTPUT)
- RA8875 Driver Board for 40-pin TFT Touch Displays, bought from the Adafruit website (OUTPUT)

## Challenges

I anticipate the whole project to be very challenging, as most of the parts are ones I've never touched before. I imagine to struggle a lot with trying to code all the curves, so I will need to figure out a way to make the process easier. Maybe try painting by hand - which I am sure will prove to be just as challenging with the amount of lines of code.

## Timeline

- Week 1: Write proposal
- Week 2: Order all the parts
- Half of week 2, week 3 & 4: Start coding the paintings, check to see if everything is transferred through the hardware properly
- Week 5: Presentation of final project
